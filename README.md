# impop
impopular curve arrangements

This repo contains code to work with curve arrangements in Haskell. 
It contains a collection of features, which may be separated at some point in the future:
- representation of curve arrangements as planar subdivisions;
- visualisation of curve arrangements;
- dynamic changes of curve arrangements;
- force-directed optimization of curve arrangements;
- recognition of impopular faces;
- application to curved nonograms.
